Before running the server run the populate_db.py script.
Flask should be the only requirement/dependency.
Please run in chrome.

**Things I would do if I had more time:** 

* Use an actual framework, along with making it look a lot nicer.
* Implement sorting in the query for the frontend.
* More thorough unit testing.
* Use an actual database.

**Misc:** 

* I didn't put much inline comments as i feel good code should not need too much comment lines and logs should show what's going on anyway.
* Flask was chosen as that's what I'm most comfortable with and could get up and running quickly.
